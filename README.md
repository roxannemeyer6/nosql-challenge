# nosql-challenge
nosql-challenge week 12
In this challenge, we were given the following prompt: The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles. 
We used MongoDb and Visual Studio code to import then maniplulate the files. There are two different codes. Notably, I imported the datainto mongo DB under a database I called "uk_food" then a collection called "establishments"
